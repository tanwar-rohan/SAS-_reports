Case Study One: Baseline Characteristics Analysis

        Overview
        
                This repository contains the SAS program and associated outputs for analyzing the baseline characteristics of patients in a randomized trial. The analysis focuses on comparing two treatment groups (TRT X and TRT Y) across several demographic and clinical variables, including sex, origin, and age.
        
        Goal of the Analysis
        
                The primary goal of this case study is to:
                
                Summarize and compare the baseline characteristics of patients randomized into two treatment groups.
                
                Identify potential imbalances or trends between the groups for demographic and clinical variables.
                
                Provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset to assist in understanding the population under study.
        
        Data Description
        
                The dataset includes the following variables:
                
                Sex: Distribution of male and female patients in both treatment groups.
                
                Origin: Geographic or ethnic origin of the patients (Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic).
                
                Age: Age-related statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each group and overall.
        
        Ad-Hoc Analysis Conducted
        
                Gender Distribution Analysis:
                
                        Count and percentage of male and female patients were calculated for each treatment group and overall.
                
                        Observations:
                
                        TRT X had a higher proportion of males (62.07%) compared to TRT Y (53.33%).
                        
                        Overall, males constituted 57.63% of the study population.
                
                Origin Analysis:
                
                        Patients were categorized by geographic or ethnic origin (Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic).
                        
                        Observations:
                        
                        Caucasian patients were the largest group across both treatments.
                        
                        A slightly higher percentage of Hispanic patients were in TRT Y compared to TRT X.
        
                Age Analysis:
                
                        Key descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum) were calculated for each group and overall.
                        
                        Observations:
                        
                        The mean age was similar between the two groups (TRT X: 40.07, TRT Y: 41.20).
                        
                        Age distribution was consistent, with no significant outliers noted.
        
        Key Findings
        
                The demographic variables (sex and origin) showed relatively balanced distributions between the two treatment groups, although minor variations were observed.
                
                Age-related statistics indicated a similar patient profile across both groups, supporting comparability.
        
        Future Goals
        
                Perform statistical hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests or chi-square tests) to assess the significance of observed differences.
                
                Expand the analysis to include additional baseline variables (e.g., medical history, comorbidities).
                
                Develop visualizations to complement the tabular data and improve interpretability.
